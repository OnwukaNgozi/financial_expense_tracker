# EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project focuses on the understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. We will be implementing two classes, Expense and ExpenseDatabase, to model and manage financial expenses.

# This project focuses on;
Defining and using classes in Python.
Working with timestamps to track when expenses are created and updated.
Managing a collection of objects efficiently.
Generating unique identifiers for each expense.

# I carried out two primary classes which are;
Expense Class(for individual expenses): It consist of ID, title, amount, created at and updated at. The code initializes a new expense with unique ID, set the creation time and stores the expense details, it also allows users to modify the title and amount of an existing expense and updates the timestamp. Finally, it converts the expense object into a dictionary for easy storage and retrieval.
Expense database(for managing multiple expenses): This has a list that stores multiple expenses. It initializes an empty list to store expenses, adds new expenses to the list, removes expenses using unique ID, retrieves expenses by ID and title and finally converts to a dictionary.

# The system is designed to;
Create an expense.
Automatically assigns unique ID’s to the expense.
Stores expense in a database.
Retrieve expenses by ID or title.
Update an expense by modify the title or amount.
Delete expense using its ID.
Display all expenses as a list of dictionary.

# How to Clone it
To clone this repository;
Navigate to the repository.
Copy the URL from the code section.
Open your terminal and use the command git clone repository_url in the directory you want the local copy to be created. This will download a copy of the repository in your directory for you to work with.

# How to run the code
In my main.Py file, I add additional scripts for testing the the code to ensure it works.
